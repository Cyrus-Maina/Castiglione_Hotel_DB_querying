# Castiglione_Hotel_DB_querying
We have this hotel's business database and business problems which we solve by querying the database. We then provided recommendations and insights that will help the hotel make data-driven decisions.

A PDF Report is also provided which consists of all recommendations and insights from the queries.

Each CSV file is a result of the querying in tabular form.

Each SQL Script has a business problem, querying code, recommendations, and insights.

A PNG Image of the ER Diagram is provided that will help you understand how the tables are related.
